#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 


## Introduction

The goal of this project was to identify lane lines on a road using a
combination of computer vision techniques. Specifically the input to the
pipeline is a series of images and the output is a new image with transparent
lines overlayed on the lane lines.

### 1. Pipeline Description

TODO: Specifically describe lane line detection.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 
In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...
If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
